Scope of the DEI.md File

Our project prioritizes and reflects on DEI through a regular review of project policies and performance. This reflection is documented in the following DEI.md file based on specific [CHAOSS project](https://chaoss.community) DEI metrics. 

### [Project Access](https://chaoss.community/?p=4953)
* Specific points on how your project addresses project access.
  
### [Communication Transparency](https://chaoss.community/?p=4957)
* Specific points on how your project addresses communication transparency. 
           
### [Newcomer Experiences](https://chaoss.community/?p=4891)
* Specific points on how your project addresses the newcomer experience.
  
### [Inclusive Leadership](https://chaoss.community/?p=3522)
* Specific points on how your project addresses inclusive leadership. 

Our project recognizes that the inclusion of the DEI.md file and the provided reflection on the specific DEI metrics does not ensure community safety nor community inclusiveness. The inclusion of the DEI.md file signals that we, as a project, are committed to centering DEI in our project and regularly reviewing and reflecting on our project DEI practices.

If you do not feel that the DEI.md file appropriately addresses concerns you have about community safety and inclusiveness, please let us know. You can do this by reporting your concerns to our Code of Conduct team (provide a link to your code of conduct team) to raise concerns you have. (If there is no Code of Conduct team, please replace the last sentence with an appropriate reporting process).
